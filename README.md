| CPU        | Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz |

### Normal function

- The sound card driver is normal, no broken sound is found.
- The configuration page is displayed normally.
- All functions are used normally, no error, including APP Store, ~~Facetime~~, iTunes, etc.
- The touchpad and battery are normal
- Normal sleep
- ~~Bluetooth has not been used, I don't know. . .~~
- On the machine ~ ~ all interfaces ~ ~ are normal, except the type-c interface has not been tried, I have no accessories for this interface
- The wired network card is normal, and the wireless network card has no solution.
- The original power supply is normal and the battery display is patches.
- Perfect to achieve unplugged boot (OMEN is the most difficult to solve this!)
- USB limitation, I don’t know if it’s released or not at all.[远景有篇帖子可以看看](http://bbs.pcbeta.com/viewthread-1804129-1-1.html)
- Wait a minute, not one by one!

### Invalid function

- ~~Small sun (brightness adjustment) is normal, patched~~ , can be adjusted at 10.13.6, need to be re-created separately at 10.14.5.
- FaceTime can be activated in 10.13.6 and below, and I can talk to my classmate's iPhone, but 10.14.5 is not working, I am still looking for the reason!
- Bluetooth needs to be activated separately (I have almost never used the Bluetooth of my laptop anyway, so I want to be lazy!)
- Type-c should not be used.
- Due to the well-known reasons, the wireless network card can not be driven, only rely on USB network card, wired network or a network card to solve, such as: Broadcom BCM94352z
- The keyboard can't adjust the brightness temporarily, so wait until you have time to manage it!
- It is impossible to drive the drop alone, everyone knows this!
- HDMI cannot be used because it can't be driven alone! There should be other solutions.
- Other problems have not been discovered for a while, or have not noticed. After all, everyone's use level is different. My requirement is to be able to simply entertain the office!

### Common problem

**Q:How to enter the BIOS or set the startup item?**

A:Press the ESC button after booting, then select according to the guidelines.

**Q:Do I need to log in to my Apple account?**

A:It is recommended to use the trumpet to log in, otherwise it may be blacked out by apple!

**Q:Why is it available on your computer, but not on my computer?**

A:I don't know, you can try to ask your computer: Why can't you?

**Q:Why is it so expensive?**

A:Google Search: How to disable discrete graphics to save battery.

**Q:Why is there no HiDPI?**

A:I can't solve all the problems. If you can help me, I am so grateful to you!

### 🔊Solutions that speakers can't use

The sound card of Shadow Elves 3 is ALC295, find the `VoodooHDA-295.pkg` I provided in repo and install it. I am lazy, only provide this kind of solution, if you have a better plan, welcome to share!
